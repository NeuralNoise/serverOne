 MaNGOSVB is based on Spurious written by the Spurious Team but the project has
 been inactive for many years. To them, we are eternally grateful.
 
 In June 2013 the MaNGOS team decided to bring it into the MaNGOS family and try
 and help progress it by reusing some of the technical knowledge and expertise
 that the MaNGOS team already had.
